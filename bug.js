This error typically occurs when using Expo CLI with a project that has a misconfigured or outdated `package.json` file.  Specifically, the issue arises when the Expo CLI cannot find or correctly interpret the necessary dependencies or scripts needed to run your project. This might stem from incorrect version numbers, missing dependencies, or inconsistencies between your project's configuration and the Expo CLI's expectations.
